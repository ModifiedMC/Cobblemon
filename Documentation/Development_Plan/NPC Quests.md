**NPC Quests** are questlines designed to engage players through immersive storytelling, systemic integration, and dynamic interaction with the world and its characters.

## Purpose and Role

NPC Quests serve three primary purposes:

1. **Immersion & Worldbuilding**: Establish lore, recurring characters, and an evolving world. They help demonstrate that the server is a deliberately designed experience, not a procedurally generated one. Updates to the world may be reflected in new or evolving NPC storylines.
    
2. **Progression & Feature Access**: Gate and guide access to features such as guilds, dungeons, skill trees, or custom items like PokéBag modules. Many quests serve as tutorials and entry points into more advanced systems.
    
3. **Content Delivery**: Provide meaningful activities through one-time and repeatable quests, some of which may be locked behind conditions such as guild membership, skill progression, or world accomplishments.
    

## Quest Structure

NPC Quests come in several structural types:

- **Main Story Quests**: Key lore or milestone-based quests that move the world narrative forward or provide access to major features.
    
- **Side Quests**: Optional, narrative-driven content with world flavor, often referencing known NPCs, towns, or guilds.
    
- **Repeatable Quests**: Time-gated tasks offering renewable rewards; reset frequency may be hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.
    
- **World Secrets**: Hidden or obscure quests that unlock powerful lore-based or cosmetic rewards.
    
- **Server-Wide Quests**: Community objectives that require large-scale cooperation (e.g., charging a dynamo to trigger a unique world event).
    
- **Player/Guild-Inspired Quests**: Quests referencing or responding to notable players, guilds, or player-driven events.
    

Some quests may be triggered or completed automatically based on player actions, secret conditions, or hidden objectives. These may include secret discoveries, specific in-world interactions, or background progress markers. This mechanic allows quests to emerge naturally during exploration or experimentation, and encourages replayability and curiosity. These quests do not require traditional acceptance or turn-in and are used to create moments of discovery, mystery, or dynamic world response. 

Depending on their design, they may also immediately appear as tracked objectives in the player's quest log, remain hidden until a later reveal, or be visible but not actively tracked in the player's quest HUD. This level of control allows developers to guide the player's awareness and focus without overwhelming their active quest list. This provides developers with flexible control over how and when the player becomes aware of an emergent quest’s presence.
## Rewards & Progression

Quest rewards may include:

- **TXP** (Tree Experience)
    
- **Dungeon Tokens & Prestige**
    
- **Items, Currency, Pokémon**
    
- **Guild Gems** (in rare GM-level questlines)
    

Some quests may grant or require **contracts** (via the contract system), such as an Initiate contract with a guild. These are usually tied to onboarding or learning systems rather than gating high-end rewards, as contracts rely on player-to-player interaction and could otherwise be easily exploited (e.g., players repeatedly forming and breaking contracts to complete objectives illegitimately).

## Quest Gating & Reactivity

NPC quests may be gated behind:

- Active guild membership or specific trees
    
- TXP milestones
    
- Completion of other quests (NPC or FTB)
    
- Dungeon completion or item acquisition
    

Quests are **reactive**:

- Dialogue and steps may change based on your guild, trees, or progress
    
- You may receive **different versions** of a quest depending on your highest-TXP tree
    
- Completion methods and choices may trigger **persistent flags** unique to each player. These flags can affect how later quests play out, providing deeper personalization and long-term impact.
    

If implementation allows, **player decision analytics** may be gathered from quests with multiple outcomes. This data could help inform future NPC or world evolution. For example, in a quest where the player advises an NPC to become either a farmer or a trainer, if the majority choose the trainer path, the NPC might be updated later to reflect that choice.

## World-State Influence

Some quests may influence persistent elements of the world:

- Unlocked by server-wide milestone events
    
- May result in world features (e.g., outbreaks, new NPCs) that persist
    
- For example, developers may place a unique dynamo item in a player-run town. If the community collaborates to farm and deliver a special event item, the dynamo activates and causes a large-scale Pikachu outbreak with increased shiny chances and IV rates.
    
- Some quests may be tied to PokéDungeon events. For instance, if a player discovers and defeats or catches a legendary Pokémon hidden deep within a dungeon, this may complete a server-wide quest and alter the dungeon’s layout for a limited time. This can be achieved by replacing the affected floor with an alternate version of it, known as a [[Modified Cobblemon/Shared Documents/Development Plan/PokéDungeons.md#Dungeon Layout & Environmental Mechanics#Floor Variants|Floor Variant]], which may reflect a changed state (e.g., the secret path has crumbled and become inaccessible for a number of days or weeks).
    
- These are never permanently negative, and are often secret, challenging, or rare
    

## Limitations & Rarity

Some quests may:

- Be **permanently limited** to a single completion by one player
    
- Be **temporarily limited** but reset over time (e.g., seasonal legendary Pokémon events)
    
- Use **NPC-to-player** **contracts with deadlines** as part of their objective or submission
    

## Named Characters & Continuity

NPCs include named, recurring characters that appear across questlines and updates. Some quests may even reference or honor real players, especially if they have significantly contributed to the server’s narrative or progression. These may appear as rivals, mentors, or inspiration within the story.

Some players may eventually appear as NPCs themselves, serving as rewards for having gained notoriety, or be mentioned by other NPCs in dialogue. For instance, a seasonal champion may be referenced by a young rookie trainer NPC who challenges the player with knockoff versions of their team, wondering what he's doing wrong after each loss.

Pre-existing NPCs may also evolve over time. If implementation allows, developers with the ability to edit NPCs directly can update their dialogue to reflect current world events or the progress of the player base. This allows the server to maintain a dynamic world where NPCs feel alive and reactive. Even outside of active quests, some NPCs may offer updated, world-aware comments — encouraging players to check in with them periodically to see what’s changed.

Quests may also be designed to dynamically respond to a player's main story progress. Certain side quests or end-game quests may unlock only after major milestones and may appear in earlier, low-level areas — rewarding players who revisit and explore familiar zones as the world opens up.

Some questlines may later be granted to or modified for specific player towns or guilds, either as a form of recognition or to anchor deeper narrative hooks into player-created spaces.

Developers may also collaborate directly with prominent players — such as town leaders or Guild Masters — to co-create special event quests or permanent questlines. These collaborative stories can further personalize the world and reinforce the connection between player actions and the evolving server narrative.

These quests serve multiple roles across progression, narrative, and gameplay access, reinforcing the server's status as a living world shaped by both developers and players.
