**Dynamic Events** are limited-time activities designed to inject excitement, foster community interaction, and offer unique challenges and rewards in parallel with regular content updates and major features like new PokéDungeon releases. These events are typically short-lived (ranging from a few hours to a full week) to encourage active participation and make their exclusive rewards feel valuable. The core philosophy is to provide engaging content that breaks the routine and gives players memorable experiences and distinct goals.

### Key Features & Mechanics:

- **Variety of Event Types:**
    
    - **Cobblemon Community Focus Days:**
        - **Featured Pokémon:** Each event will spotlight a single, specific Pokémon species.
        - **Massively Increased Spawns:** The featured Pokémon will appear much more frequently in the wild globally, or in designated, widespread biomes, for a dedicated block of hours (e.g., 3-6 hours on a weekend day).
        - **Increased Shiny Chance:** During the event hours, there will be a significantly increased probability of encountering a shiny version of the featured Pokémon.
        - **Event Bonuses:** Additional potential bonuses during these hours could include increased Pokémon XP, reduced egg hatching distance (if applicable), changes to the fishing spawn pools, or special Field Research-style tasks focused on the featured Pokémon.
        - **Advance Announcement:** These Community Focus Days will be announced well in advance to allow players to prepare (e.g., stock up on Poké Balls, clear Pokémon storage).
    - **World Boss Encounters:** A formidable, custom-designed "World Boss" (could be a giant, uniquely powerful Pokémon variant or a completely custom creature) spawns at a predetermined time and location. Defeating it requires a server-wide collaborative effort, with rewards scaled by participation, damage contribution, and successful takedown.
    - **Themed Treasure Hunts:** Server-wide hunts involving riddles, parkour, exploration clues scattered across multiple dimensions, leading to hidden stashes of valuable loot, event tokens, or unique collectibles.
    - **Limited-Time Dungeons:** Special, non-PokéDungeon instances appear for the event's duration. These dungeons would feature custom layouts, unique mobs (potentially event-themed reskins of existing mobs or new custom ones), challenging bosses, and exclusive loot tables (e.g., event currency, rare crafting materials, specific event-themed Pokémon).
    - **Community Challenge Events:** Server-wide objectives are set (e.g., "Collect 1,000,000 Cobblestone," "Catch 5,000 Pokemon," "Plant 10,000 Saplings across all towns"). Upon completion by the community, a global reward, a temporary server-wide buff (e.g., increased Pokémon XP, better loot from PokéStops), or a new temporary feature is unlocked for everyone.
    - **Holiday & Seasonal Celebrations:** Special events themed around real-world holidays or significant seasonal changes (distinct from the Seasonal Pokémon League). Examples:
        - **Halloween Haunt:** Ghost-type Pokémon focus, spooky-themed areas with temporary quests, and cosmetic costume rewards.
        - **Winter Festival:** Ice-type Pokémon focus, gift-exchanging systems, decorative town contests, and chances to find rare winter-themed items.
    - **Town-Hosted Mini-Festivals:** The server may provide support (e.g., kits with decorative blocks, temporary NPC vendors, minor prize support) for player towns to organize their own local events like fishing contests, building competitions, or small-scale Pokémon tournaments, fostering town identity and community spirit.
    - **Fishing Derbies & Bug Catching Contests:** Timed competitions to catch the largest, rarest, or most of a specific type of fish or bug-themed Pokémon, with leaderboards and prizes.
    - **Themed Building Contests:** Server-announced themes (e.g., "Best Pokémon Gym Design," "Most Innovative Redstone Contraption"), with designated areas or plot worlds for building, judged by staff or community vote.


- **Reward Structures:**
    
    - **Event Currency/Tokens:** Earned by participating in event activities, redeemable at a special event vendor for exclusive items.
    - **Exclusive Collectibles:** Time-limited items such as custom-textured tools/weapons (cosmetic), event-specific trophies (placeable furniture), unique banner patterns, titles, or collectible coins/medallions with high in-game trade value.
    - **Event-Themed Pokémon:** As detailed in Custom Mods, Pokémon with unique event-specific textures, minor cosmetic accessories (e.g., a party hat), or occasionally a special non-advantageous move (like "Celebrate"). These would not be breedable with their special textures/accessories to maintain rarity. This is especially relevant for Community Focus Day Pokémon.
    - **Cosmetic Gear:** Unique armor sets (cosmetic only, perhaps using armor stand mods or similar), hats, particle effects, or custom-designed non-PokéBag backpacks.
    - **Rare Resources & Items:** Enhanced chances to obtain rare crafting materials (e.g., AllTheModium ores), high-tier enchantment books, Ability Patches/Fragments, or even Guild Gems.
    - **Guild & Town Incentives:** Bonus Guild Points for collective guild participation, resources for Guild HQ development, or special recognition/trophies for towns that excel in community events or festivals.


- **Engagement & Accessibility:**
    
    - **Event-Specific Questlines:** Short FTB Quest lines will be available to guide players through the event's activities, explain its mechanics, and offer baseline participation rewards.
    - **Announcements & In-Game Calendar:** Clear communication about upcoming and active events via in-game broadcasts, a visible event calendar/bulletin board UI, and Discord announcements.
    - **Leaderboards & Recognition:** For competitive events, visible leaderboards will track top performers, who will be publicly recognized and rewarded.
    - **Translation:** Key event information and questlines will be translated to ensure accessibility for the diverse player base.

- **Frequency & Duration:** A general cadence might involve one major weekend event (like a Limited-Time Dungeon or World Boss) per month, with one **Cobblemon Community Focus Day** also occurring monthly on a different weekend. Smaller, more frequent occurrences could happen for a few hours on different days to cater to various time zones.
