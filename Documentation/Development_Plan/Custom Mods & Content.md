### 1. The Modified Experience (Core Integration & GUI Mod)

This central mod acts as the primary interface and integration hub for many of the modpack's unique features and custom systems. Its main purpose is to provide players with a streamlined way to access critical information and interact with various gameplay elements through a custom, user-friendly GUI.

- **Custom Main GUI Features:**
    
    - **Information Hub:** A unified interface to access:
        - **Dungeon Information:** Details on available PokéDungeons and other dungeons, including types, recommended levels, and potential unique loot.
        - **Event Information:** A calendar and description for current and upcoming server events (from the `#Running Events` system), including objectives and special rewards.
        - **Trainer & Gym Information:** Displays player's current Pokémon team level caps, personal trainer stats (like PokéDollar balance), and detailed information on recognized Gyms (player-operated from the `#Seasonal Pokémon League`), their types, leaders, if they are accepting battles, active hours, or if there are any specific challenge rules.
        - **Server & Modpack Info:** Quick access to server rules, links to important community platforms, and basic guides or version info for key mods.
        
    - **Player Interaction:**
        - **Trainer Battle Interface:** A system for players to easily find and initiate battles with other trainers, potentially including a challenge list, elo/ranking display, or quick battle options.
        
    - **Quick Access & Utility:**
        - **PokéBag Hotkey Integration:** Provides the functionality for a dedicated hotkey to directly open the player's PokéBag (from the separate PokéBag Mod).
        - **PokéDollar Balance Display:** Clearly shows the player's current in-game currency.

- **System Integration & Compatibility:**
    - This mod will be crucial for ensuring seamless interaction between different complex systems:
    
        - **Towns & Guilds System:** "The Modified Experience" will house the UI elements and integration logic necessary for players to interact with the custom Guild system, its skill trees, and the Guild Quest (GQ) and Guild Skill Quest (GSQ) framework detailed in the `#Towns & Guilds` section.
        - **Contract System:** The interface for creating, viewing, and managing player-to-player and guild-related contracts (as defined in `#Towns & Guilds`) will be managed through this mod.

- **Pokémon Item Additions & Reimplementations:**
    - "The Modified Experience" will also be the vehicle for introducing a variety of Pokémon items not yet implemented in Cobblemon or new custom items to enrich gameplay. These will be designed to integrate with other systems like Guilds, crafting, and exploration. Examples include:
    
        - **New Held Items:** Items that offer unique passive effects in battle or during training.
        - **New Consumables & Craftables:** Utility items for trainers in the field (e.g., "Portable Pokémon Healer Kit," stronger "Repel Sprays/Incense," type-specific "Encounter Lures," "Ability Patch Fragments" for crafting).
        - **Specialized Crafting Ingredients:** Unique materials needed for high-tier items, guild upgrades, or module crafting for the PokéBag, encouraging engagement with various aspects of the modpack.
        - **PokeStops, Lures, Etc**: Reimplementing various items from other games such as PokemonGo

### 2. Dungeon System 

 These systems and resources will be crucial for our gameplay, housing many of the systems for the features discussed in this document to come to fruition.

- **Custom Blocks & Items**
	- Includes the dungeon keys, portal blocks, and any other blocks required for the dungeons to function 

- **Portal Resources**
	-  Dynamic portal textures, and sounds depending on the dungeon its used to travel to.

- **Showdown Changes**
	 - Possible changes and additions to the Cobblemon Showdown system, possibly required for the boss tier of mon in development

### 3. Custom Pokémon Textures

This mod (or integrated feature set) aims to introduce a wider variety of visual appearances for Pokémon beyond their standard and shiny forms, enhancing the collectability and visual diversity of Cobblemon.

- **Purpose:**
    - **Enhanced Collectibility:** Provide players with more unique Pokémon to find, train, and show off.
    - **Visual Diversity:** Make the Pokémon world feel richer and more varied.
    - **Event Rewards:** Offer special textured Pokémon as prizes for participating in Running Events or Seasonal Pokémon League tournaments.
    - **Rare Variants:** Introduce textures that are exceptionally rare, like "Albino," "Melanistic," biome-specific camouflage patterns (e.g., "Desert Rattata," "Arctic Pikachu"), or even "Retro" pixel-art inspired textures, found in the wild or through specific, challenging breeding achievements.
    - **Non-Intrusive:** These textures would be purely cosmetic and offer no gameplay advantages, preserving competitive balance. They would be an additional layer for collectors and those who appreciate visual flair. Integration with "The Modified Experience" GUI could allow players to see a "Texture Dex" or similar.

### 4. Event-Themed Pokémon

This mod or feature set allows for the introduction of Pokémon with special themes tied to server events (as detailed in `#Dynamic Events`), holidays, or ongoing server story arcs.

- **Features:**
    - **Unique Appearances:** Pokémon might receive temporary or permanent custom textures fitting the event (e.g., a pumpkin-themed Pikachu for Halloween, a flower-crowned Eevee for a Spring festival). They might also feature minor, non-obtrusive cosmetic accessories (if technically feasible) or unique particle effects.
    - **Special Moves (Cosmetic/Thematic):** Rarely, an event Pokémon might know a specific, thematically named move. If it has a unique battle effect, it would be a balanced, existing move re-skinned for the event, or a purely cosmetic move like "Celebrate" or "Happy Hour."
    - **Limited Availability:** These Pokémon would primarily be obtainable only during the specific event they are tied to, increasing their rarity and value as collectibles.
    - **Story & Quest Integration:** Event-themed Pokémon could play a role in temporary `#NPC Quests` or the narrative of a running event, making their appearance feel more integrated into the world.
    - **Collection Challenges:** Events could feature short-term collection challenges or Pokédex-style objectives centered around finding and cataloging these event-themed Pokémon, with rewards for completion. These would also be visible through "The Modified Experience" event UI.

### 5. PokéBag Mod (Standalone Utility Mod)

This mod introduces a dedicated inventory solution for Pokémon trainers, designed with thematic accuracy and ease of use in mind. It is intended to be a focused mod that can be utilized by the broader Cobblemon community in other modpacks as well.

- **Single Tier, Modular Design:**
    - There will be one primary "PokéBag" item. Its functionality is expanded not through tiered crafting of new bags, but by acquiring and installing distinct **Modules**.
- **Pokémon Game Inspired Interface:**
    - The bag's GUI will closely mimic the interface seen in the mainline Pokémon games.
    - Items will be automatically sorted into logical categories within the bag, each accessible via clear tabs or sections:
        - **Medicine Pocket:** For Potions, Status Healers, Revives, etc.
        - **Poké Balls Pocket:** Organizes all types of Poké Balls.
        - **TMs/HMs Pocket:** Stores Technical and Hidden Machines.
        - **Berries Pocket:** Dedicated space for all collected Berries.
        - **Key Items Pocket:** For important progression-related items, ensuring they are not accidentally discarded. 
        - **Battle Items Pocket:** For X-items, Dire Hits, Guards Specs etc.
        - **Treasures/Valuables Pocket:** For items primarily meant to be sold (Nuggets, Stardust, etc.) or rare collectibles.
        - **Held Items Compartment:** A section specifically for managing Pokémon Held Items.
- **Module Acquisition & Progression:**
    - While the base PokéBag might be relatively easy to obtain or craft, many of its specialized **Modules** (which unlock or expand specific pockets/features, or add new functionality like an integrated Egg Incubator slot or a Bait & Lure Satchel) will be locked during initial gameplay.
    - These modules will primarily be obtained as rewards from completing specific NPC quests, storyline milestones, or challenging dungeons, providing a clear progression path for enhancing the bag's utility.
- **Standalone & Sharable:**
    - Developed as an independent mod, allowing other Cobblemon modpack creators to easily incorporate it if they wish, promoting a common, high-quality utility for the community.
