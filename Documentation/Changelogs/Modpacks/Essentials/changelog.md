# [v1.2.0]
-  Huge Balancing Changes & Complete Quest Overhual - [18-06-2025]

## Performance & Stability

* **Crash & Performance Fixes:** Addressed several underlying issues that were causing client crashes and poor pack performance for a more stable playing experience.
* **Tons of mods up to date:** Over 100 mods in the modpack received an update. Notable ones being Create with lots of bug fixes for its new systems, Tectonic with various worldgen improvements, & a ton of the cobbemon sidemods included in this pack.
* **Default Settings Adjustment:** To ensure a smoother initial experience for all players, Shaders and Distant Horizons are now **disabled by default**. Players are encouraged to enable and configure these in their settings menu. Distant Horizons settings are particularly hardware-dependent, so please tweak them carefully to match your system's capabilities (e.g., offloading to GPU or CPU).
* **Optimized Mob Spawning:** Overhauled the InControl mob limits for nearly every entity in the game. These new caps limit the number of non-essential mobs that can spawn per player, significantly improving performance and prioritizing the spawning of Cobblemon.

## The Great Quest Overhaul!

This update introduces a **complete overhaul of the questing system**, with over **1000 new quests** designed to guide, challenge, and reward players of all types!

### Seasonal Field Research

    * **Tech & Automation:** Tutorials for Create and all other major tech mods.
    * **Quality of Life:** Explanations for many of the helpful client-side and utility mods.
* **New Main Chapters:**
    * **Mob Hunter:** A new chapter for adventurers and completionists focused on tracking down and defeating various creatures.

* **Balanced Spawn Pools:** The Cobblemon spawn pools have been rebalanced for a more diverse and engaging world.
* **Expanded Ride List:** Added many more Pokémon to the list of rideable mounts.
* **New Mounting System:** You can now easily mount your Pokémon directly from the Cobblemon interaction wheel (Shift + Right-Click your lead Pokémon).

## Economy & Balancing
